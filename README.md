# Free Code Camp Voting App

## How it works

The entire front-end is a React app which calls to a JSON API built with Express
and MongoDB.

It fetches / "pings" the current users username from the back end every 10 seconds
and updates the front end to either show or hide elements based on whether or not
the user is logged in.

## Built with

- Express 4
- MongoDB
  - Mongoose
- Passport
  - GitHub2
- React
  - React Router
- Google Charts
- Bootstrap (with custom theme)

All built in under a day.
